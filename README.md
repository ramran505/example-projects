# Example Projects

This repository is a collection of small, language-diverse projects created for the purpose of **testing, analysis, and experimentation**.  
It is not intended for production use, but rather as a resource for exploring code structures across different programming languages and for evaluating tools such as static analyzers, build systems, or CI pipelines.

---

## 📂 Contents

The repository includes example applications in multiple languages, such as:

- **C / C++** – Basic console applications that log messages or greetings.
- **Java** – Simple programs demonstrating class structures and CLI output.
- **Python** – Lightweight scripts for message logging and basic arithmetic.
- **Ruby** – Minimal examples showcasing CLI-based greetings and logging.

Each project is intentionally small in scope, focusing on simple tasks like printing to the console, logging text, or handling basic inputs. This allows easy comparison of syntax and program structure between languages.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

These projects serve several objectives:

- **Cross-language comparison** – Observe how different programming languages handle the same fundamental tasks.  
- **Tool testing** – Run static analysis tools (e.g., Microsoft Application Inspector, linters, security scanners) on a diverse codebase.  
- **Educational use** – Provide minimal examples for learning the basics of multiple languages.  
- **CI/CD experimentation** – Test multi-language build pipelines and automation scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the examples, navigate into the respective project folder and use the appropriate compiler or interpreter:

- **C / C++**  

```bash
  gcc example.c -o example && ./example
  g++ example.cpp -o example && ./example
````

- **Java**

```bash
  javac Example.java
  java Example
```

- **Python**

```bash
  python3 example.py
```

- **Ruby**

```bash
  ruby example.rb
```

## 🔍 Notes

* The code is intentionally simple, focusing on structure rather than features.
* Some projects may include minimal variations (e.g., greeting messages, logging styles).
* Contributions are not required, as the purpose of this repository is consistency for analysis rather than feature development.
